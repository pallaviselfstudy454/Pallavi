1) CALCULATOR Program:

package labs;
public class calculator
{
		public void add(int a, int b) {
			System.out.println("Addition");
			int r = a+b;
			System.out.println(r);
		}
		public void sub(int a, int b) {
			System.out.println("Substraction");
			int r = a-b;
			System.out.println(r);
		}
		public void mult(int a, int b) {
			System.out.println("Multiplication");
			int r = a*b;
			System.out.println(r);
		}
		public void div(int a, int b) {
			System.out.println("Division");
			int r = a/b;
			System.out.println(r);
		}
		public static void main (String []args) {
			calculator c1 = new calculator();
			calculator c2 = new calculator();
			calculator c3 = new calculator();
			calculator c4 = new calculator();
			c1.add(5,  5);
			c2.sub(10, 6);
			c3.mult(25, 5);
			c4.div(152, 6);

		}
}


OUTPUT :
	Addition
